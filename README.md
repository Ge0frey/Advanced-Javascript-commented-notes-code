## Nested Functions

Explains the concept of nested functions and demonstrates its usage.

## Closures in JavaScript

Illustrates closures in JavaScript and how they can be used.

## Currying

Transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take one argument each.

## Types of Binding in JavaScript

Covers different types of binding in JavaScript, including implicit binding.

## Prototype

Demonstrates the use of prototypes to inherit methods between objects.

## Class (Syntactical Sugar)

Introduces the class syntax, a more convenient way to create objects and handle inheritance.

## Loops

Examples of using traditional for loops and for...of loops for strings and arrays.

## Iterable Object

Shows how to create an iterable object in JavaScript using Symbol.iterator.

## Generator Function

Introduces generator functions and demonstrates their usage.

## Higher Order Functions

Applies logic to higher-order functions, including functions for calculating area and circumference.

## Map, Filter, and Reduce

Utilizes the 
`.map()`, 
`.filter()`, and 
`.reduce()` methods for array manipulation.

## Asynchronous JavaScript

Covers various aspects of asynchronous JavaScript, including: 
callbacks, 
promises, and 
async/await.

Feel free to explore each section to understand and experiment with different JavaScript concepts.

To run each code comment out the other code and then use node main on your terminal

Remember, To know code ypu have to see code.

HAPPY CODING
