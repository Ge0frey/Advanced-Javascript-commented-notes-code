# Advanced JavaScript Concepts Learning Notes

## Overview
This repository contains code examples illustrating various advanced JavaScript concepts. These examples serve as a learning resource for those interested in deepening their understanding of JavaScript. The code covers topics such as nested functions, closures, currying, different types of binding, prototypes, classes, loops, and generator functions.

## Nested Functions
The code demonstrates the concept of nested functions, showcasing how functions can be defined within other functions, and how they can access variables from their outer scopes.

## Closures in JavaScript
Explore the concept of closures, where inner functions retain access to the variables of their outer functions even after the outer function has completed execution.

## Currying
Learn about currying, a technique that transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each takes a single argument.

## Types of Binding in JavaScript
Understand different types of binding in JavaScript, including implicit binding and explicit binding using the `call` method.

## The `this` Keyword
Explore the usage of the `this` keyword in different contexts, including implicit binding and using the `call` method to explicitly set the value of `this`.

## Prototypes
Dive into the concept of prototypes in JavaScript, demonstrating how to inherit methods using prototypes and functions.

## Class Syntactical Sugar
Compare the traditional constructor function approach with the modern class syntax for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

## For Loop
Learn how to use a traditional `for` loop to iterate over characters in a string and elements in an array.

## For...of Loop
Explore the more modern `for...of` loop for iterating over iterable objects, including strings and arrays.

## Creating an Iterable Object
Understand how to create an iterable object using the `Symbol.iterator` property, allowing for customized iteration.

## Normal Function vs. Generator Function
Compare a normal function with a generator function, showcasing how generator functions enable pausing and resuming execution.
